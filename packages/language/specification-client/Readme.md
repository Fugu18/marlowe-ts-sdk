# Language Core Specification Client

This package contains a client that is used by the [Marlowe spec test](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe/tree/master/marlowe-spec-test) to test that the implementation of `@marlowe.io/language-core-v1` is compliant with the Marlowe Core Specification.

## Usage

```bash
$ nix develop
[nix-shell] $ npm run build
[nix-shell] $ test-spec
```
