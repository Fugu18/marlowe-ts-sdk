# Description

This package enables the creation of large contracts. A Marlowe contract is a Tree structure, and if the tree is big enough it won't fit on the blockchain. To solve that, the Marlowe Core specification has a concept called [Merkleization](https://docs.marlowe.iohk.io/docs/platform-and-architecture/large-contracts), which represents large contract as a Merkle tree's. The splitting and hashing of a large contract into a Merkle Tree is done through the runtime calls ({@link @marlowe.io/runtime-rest-client!index.RestClient#createContractSources}), and we use `marlowe-object` to define the large contract in a more approachable way. The types of the `marlowe-object` are very similar to the types of the `marlowe-core` package, but without the Merkleization part and with the adition of `references` in some types. For example, a contract can use a reference as a sub-contract instead of inlining it, allowing commonly repeated contracts to be defined once and referenced many times.
